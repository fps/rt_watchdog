this is a simple watchdog daemon that reschedules every SCHED_FIFO task in the system to SCHED_NORMAL when
it detects a hang. this also includes IRQ threads on RP systems, so make sure you set up your irq handlers  again
after it has kicked in..

Make sure, you do not run any  possibly hanging task with prio equal to or higher than the watchdog (99 by default). otherwise it 
won't work.

also make sure that the place where the unfifo_stuff.sh script is installed to
is in the path..

there's a small test program in the distribution called rt_test which simply hangs for quite a while. it will exit after a while, so you can use it to test te watchdog.
